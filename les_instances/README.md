# About

This experiment attempts to draw the viewer's attention on their perception of musicality and information. Three different views of the same piece are presented: the first in the time domain, the second in the frequency domain, and the third in a quasi-representation of the track in the 3D space. That latter representation is the most inaccurate of the three, only exposing certain attributes of the musical piece, and influenced by random elements, as the viewer would be in a live performance. A random brownian motion draws parallels from the viewer's wandering mind, suddently awakened by changes in volume and pitch, however the degree to which the musical piece's summetry and underlying structure 
is exposed is far from what is depicted. The viewer is encouraged to reflect upon their perception of the underlying symmetry of the track, the connection between the different musical elements in time and space, and their perceived visual stimulus.
